    <h2>My small bio</h2>
        <p>
            Hi and welcome! I am a Graphic and Web Designer/Developer based out of Boston. My specialty is hand coding HTML and CSS with a focus on SEO and accessibility. I've also worked in IT in the past trouble shooting technical graphic problems for designers, engineers and architects using the Adobe Applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            My strength is in my ability to apply a unique balance of artistic and technical skills to web technologies and print in terms of design constraints and potential. And I'm always seeking out the latest, best-pact ices to stay abreast of the market.
        </p>

            Oh, and I love working with metal clay and Swarovski crystals. Metal clay is fine silver (also comes in other metals) mixed with a gluten to give it a clay consistency. The gluten is burned off in the kiln process and the final piece is fine silver. So as you've probably guess, by my domain name, I'll be creating a site where I'll showcase and sell my jewelry. 
        </p>
    <h2>Name of code editor I use</h2>
        <p>
            I'm transitioning from Dreamweaver to Sublime 2. I believe that all of this great local and server setup information will expedite that transition.
