    <h2>My small bio</h2>
        <p>
        Hi and welcome! I am a Graphic and Web Designer/Developer based out of Boston. My specialty is hand coding HTML and CSS with a focus on SEO and accessibility. I've also worked in IT in the past trouble shooting technical graphic problems for designers, engineers and architects using the Adobe Applications.
        </p>
        <p>
        My strength is in my ability to apply a unique balance of artistic and technical skills to web technologies and print in terms of design constraints and potential. And I'm always seeking out the latest, best-pactices to stay abreast of the market.
    </p>
    <h2>Name of code editor I use</h2>
        <p>I switch between Sublime 2 and Dreamweaver. I like to try different things.</p>
